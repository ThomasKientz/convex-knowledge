# Managing Reactivity with useBufferedState

Play

Reactivity has taken a dominant position today within web app development. Our components and app state are all reactive, and the world has adaptedâ€“most would argue, for the better.

But has Convex gone too far? ðŸ˜‰

A new generation of serverless backends like Convex is recklessly spreading reactivity across our databases, server-side functions, and protocols, making global reactivity a new phenomenon. Shared global data is becoming reactive by default. Is this good for the world?

In this video, Jamie Turner explores one circumstance where this pervasive reactivity poses a challenge, and he builds one useful abstraction for taming over-reactivity and turning it back into a strength.
